		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Monorepo & CI/CD Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the monorepo setup, Dockerization for both applications (dev/prod), and the CI/CD pipeline configuration for automated build, test, and deployment using GitHub Actions.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to its foundational nature, involving multiple distinct technologies (monorepo tools, Docker, CI/CD) and environments (dev, prod) for two different applications. Each component requires careful configuration and integration, making it prone to environmental issues and requiring significant setup time. The recommended subtasks reflect these distinct areas."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Google OAuth & JWT Authentication",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing Google OAuth 2.0 on the NestJS backend, including JWT generation and secure storage, and integrating the login flow and protected routes on the Next.js frontend.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication is a critical and security-sensitive area. Implementing Google OAuth involves external API interaction, callback handling, and secure token management. JWT implementation requires careful consideration of generation, validation, and secure storage (e.g., HttpOnly cookies vs. local storage). The task also includes user registration/login logic and protecting API routes, which adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Design & Implement Core Data Models (PostgreSQL, TypeORM)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the process for setting up PostgreSQL and TypeORM, defining the User, Task, and Project entities with their relationships, and creating initial database migrations.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational for the application's data layer. It involves setting up the database, configuring the ORM, and carefully designing the core data models and their relationships. While individual CRUD operations might be straightforward, ensuring correct relationships, data integrity, and a robust migration strategy adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Socket.io for Real-time Updates",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for configuring Socket.io on the NestJS backend and integrating it with the Next.js frontend, including initial event handling and client-side connection management.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing real-time communication with Socket.io involves setting up a persistent connection layer on both the backend and frontend. This requires understanding WebSocket protocols, managing connections, and handling event-driven communication, which is more complex than typical REST API interactions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Core UI/UX & Mobile-First Layout",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the development of the core UI/UX, including Tailwind CSS setup, responsive layout implementation, and the creation of foundational navigation and UI components for a mobile-first design.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational for the entire frontend. It involves not just styling but establishing a robust, responsive, and maintainable UI architecture. Considerations like mobile-first design, component reusability, and adherence to design principles add to its complexity beyond simple styling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Profile & XP/Level System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation of the user profile page, including backend logic for XP acquisition and level progression, and frontend display of XP and level.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines backend data model updates and logic with frontend UI development. The gamification logic (XP calculation, level progression) requires careful implementation and testing to ensure correctness and prevent exploits."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop GTD-based Task Management System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the development of the GTD-based task management system, including the 5-step task creation flow, full CRUD operations, and smart filtering capabilities for 'Today', 'Completed', and 'All' tasks.",
			"reasoning": "This is a central feature of the application. The 'GTD 5-step sequential process' implies a more complex task creation flow than a simple form. Implementing robust CRUD operations, along with 'smart filtering' (which often involves date calculations and status management), requires significant backend logic and corresponding frontend UI."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Project Creation & Basic Collaboration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation of project creation and basic collaboration features, including backend CRUD operations for projects and member management, and corresponding frontend UI for creation, listing, and detail views.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard CRUD operations for projects. However, the 'invite/manage members' aspect introduces additional complexity related to user relationships, potential roles, and ensuring proper access control, which goes beyond simple data persistence."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Real-time Project Chat with Slash Commands",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the development of the real-time project chat, including Socket.io integration for message exchange, backend logic for parsing and executing slash commands like /add-task, and the frontend chat UI with message history.",
			"reasoning": "This task builds upon existing Socket.io infrastructure but adds significant complexity. Real-time chat requires robust message handling, history management, and efficient UI updates. The addition of slash commands introduces parsing logic and cross-feature integration (e.g., with the task service), making it a multi-faceted and challenging feature."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Momentum Score & Advanced Task Filtering",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation of the momentum score using the RICE model, including backend calculation and integration, and the development of advanced task filtering ('Later') and global search functionalities.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing a specific algorithm (RICE model) for task prioritization, which requires careful calculation and integration into task updates. Additionally, advanced filtering and global search capabilities necessitate efficient database queries and robust frontend UI to handle dynamic data display."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Google Calendar for Due Date Sync",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration with Google Calendar API for due date synchronization, including backend setup for event creation/update and frontend UI for connecting the calendar and managing sync.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating with an external API like Google Calendar is inherently complex. It involves managing OAuth 2.0 for specific scopes, handling API rate limits, implementing robust error handling, and ensuring reliable one-way synchronization of events based on task due dates."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Establish Comprehensive Testing & Monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the establishment of a comprehensive testing suite, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, and the setup of Sentry for error tracking and basic application performance monitoring.",
			"reasoning": "This task is crucial for application quality and stability. It involves setting up and configuring multiple testing frameworks (unit, integration, E2E) for both frontend and backend, which requires distinct configurations and test writing strategies. Additionally, integrating a monitoring solution like Sentry adds another layer of complexity for error tracking and observability."
